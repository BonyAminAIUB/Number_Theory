# Number Theory for Competitive Programming 🔢

This repository documents my **step-by-step learning journey of Number Theory**
for **Competitive Programming (CP)** using **C++**.

I started this repository recently and will gradually add
more **number theory concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving implementations**
as I continue learning.

---

## 📚 Learning Approach

- Begin with **basic number theory fundamentals**
- Implement each concept in **clean C++ code**
- Practice problems related to each topic
- Expand the repository **progressively over time**

This repository is meant to **grow along with my CP journey**.

---

## 📂 Current Topics
*(Will be expanded continuously)*

- Basic number operations
- Prime number checking
- Simple mathematical utilities

## 🚀 Planned Topics (Future Roadmap)

The following Number Theory concepts will be added step by step:

- Sieve of Eratosthenes  
- Prime factorization  
- GCD & LCM  
- Modular arithmetic  
- Fast exponentiation (Binary exponentiation)  
- Modular inverse  
- Euler’s Totient function  
- Divisors & divisor counting  
- Number theory tricks used in CP
